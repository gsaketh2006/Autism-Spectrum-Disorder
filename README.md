# 🧠 Autism Prediction in Adults using Machine Learning

A **machine learning–based screening system** for early prediction of **Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults**, using questionnaire responses and demographic features.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Autism Spectrum Disorder in adults often remains undiagnosed due to:
- Subtle symptoms  
- Lack of awareness  
- Limited access to trained professionals  

Traditional diagnosis methods are **time-consuming, subjective, and resource-intensive**.  
This project proposes an **automated ML-based screening tool** to assist clinicians and individuals with **faster, data-driven insights**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a **binary classification system** (ASD / Non-ASD)
- Compare multiple **machine learning algorithms**
- Handle **class imbalance** and **data quality issues**
- Identify the **most reliable model** for ASD prediction
- Provide **model interpretability** using feature importance
- Enable **real-world deployment** through a web application
