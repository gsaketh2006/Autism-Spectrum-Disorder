# Project Demo

This folder contains a demonstration of the deployed **Autism Prediction in Adults using Machine Learning** web application.

---

## Demo Overview
The demo video shows the complete workflow of the application, including:
- User interface of the web application
- Input of screening questionnaire scores and demographic details
- Model inference and prediction output
- Final classification result (ASD / Non-ASD)

---

## Demo Video
- **File Name:** demo_video.mp4  
- **Description:** A screen-recorded walkthrough of the deployed Flask web application, demonstrating how users interact with the system and receive predictions.

---

## Application Workflow
1. User enters ASD screening scores (A1–A10)
2. User provides demographic details (age, gender, etc.)
3. Input data is processed by the trained Random Forest model
4. The system predicts whether the individual is likely to have ASD
5. Result is displayed on the web interface

## Purpose of the Demo
This demo is provided to:
- Illustrate the end-to-end functionality of the system
- Help reviewers understand the user interaction flow
- Demonstrate successful deployment of the machine learning model

---

## Notes
- The demo video is for **demonstration and educational purposes only**
- The system is not intended to replace professional medical diagnosis
